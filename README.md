# Markdown footnote numeric references

This is far on my back-burned, and I'd appreciate if someone else did it lol

Basically need to impliment a markdown feature where you can reference the number of a [^footnote]

For any sizable docs, this is paramount to being able to edit after a "final" export, or otherwise interoperate between files

My rudamentary idea for the format is something like {{^footnote}} returns the number of FN if âˆƒ^footnote.
